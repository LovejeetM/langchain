# Langchain

Making this repo to dive back into the Langchain. I'm busy revisiting all the core concepts and, more excitingly, building out some cool AI Agent ideas I've had brewing. You'll see me playing around with Langchain, tapping into NVIDIA's awesome AI endpoints, all within Google Colab notebooks, and serving it up with interactive Gradio interfaces.
Also, I'll be turning this into a fully functional RAG agent, so stick aroundâ€”there's plenty more code coming, including a peek into LangGraph, too.
